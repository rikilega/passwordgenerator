  <h1 style="font-size: 40px; font-weight: bold;">Password Generator</h1>

</div>

## What Is This?:

This project is a webpage with a password generator that can be used to generate random secure passwords using user inputs to determine the length and character types to include in the password. This to showcase my work as a programmer, and help improve my programming skills. My page should meet the following requirements:

* **Relevant Information**: My name, a photo, and links to sections about me, my work and how I can be contacted are easily accessible.

* **Working nav links**: When clicked, links in the navigation take you to the corresponding section on the page.

* **Work Section Images and links**: The 'work' link in the nav bar takes me to the corresponding section with titled images of my previous applications- my first application image being larger than the rest. Each application image will take you to that deployed application if clicked.

* **Responsive layout**: When resized for viewing on different sized screens the layout is responsive and adapts to the viewport.

## Purpose of This Work:

This project is the first webpage I have made without starter code. The purpos is to provide an online space where potential employers can view samples of my work to assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position.
