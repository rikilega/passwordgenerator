</div>

## What Is This?:

This project is a webpage with a password generator that can be used to generate random secure passwords using user inputs to determine the length and character types to include in the password. This will showcase my work as a programmer in javascript, and help improve my programming skills.

## Purpose of This Work:

This project is my first project using Javascript. The purpose is to practice implementing Javascript so that I can become more familiar with the syntax and logic through the process of creating a working app using Javascript.

## Usage:
